This post explores the ``cat <<EOF`` syntax in Bash, a powerful tool for handling multi-line text. It's particularly useful when assigning a multi-line string to a shell variable, a file, or piping it into another command. The examples below are adapted from a detailed (Stack Overflow discussion)[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2500436/how-does-cat-eof-work-in-bash]



## Examples of "cat <<EOF syntax usage in Bash":
###  Assign multi-line string to a shell variable

Using ``cat <<EOF``, you can easily assign a multi-line string to a shell variable. Hereâ€™s an example:



````bash
$ sql=$(cat <<EOF
SELECT foo, bar FROM db
WHERE foo='baz'
EOF
)
````

In this case, the variable ``$sql`` retains the new-line characters. You can confirm this by printing it with ``echo -e "$sql"``.

###  Passing a Multi-line String to a File in Bash
You can also direct a multi-line string into a file using this syntax:

````bash
$ cat <<EOF > print.sh
#!/bin/bash
echo \$PWD
echo $PWD
EOF
````

The resulting ``print.sh`` file will contain the following lines:

````bash
#!/bin/bash
echo $PWD
echo /home/user
````

This script, when executed, will print the current working directory twice, illustrating how variables are expanded within the heredoc.

### Passing a Multi-line String to a Pipe in Bash

The ``cat <<EOF`` syntax can be combined with pipes for efficient text processing. For instance:

````bash
$ cat <<EOF | grep 'b' | tee b.txt
foo
bar
baz
EOF
````

This command will output lines containing '``b``' to both the standard output (stdout) and a file named '``b.txt``'. In this example, ``b.txt`` will contain the lines '``bar``' and '``baz``'.

## Conclusion

The ``cat <<EOF`` syntax in Bash is an elegant solution for managing multi-line strings. Whether it's assigning text to variables, redirecting output to files, or working with pipes, this syntax simplifies script writing and enhances readability. As demonstrated in these examples, it's a versatile tool that can be adapted to various scripting needs.
