The ``cat <<EOF`` syntax is very useful when working with multi-line text in Bash, eg. when assigning multi-line string to a shell variable, file or a pipe.


## Examples of "cat <<EOF syntax usage in Bash":
###  Assign multi-line string to a shell variable

````bash
$ sql=$(cat <<EOF
SELECT foo, bar FROM db
WHERE foo='baz'
EOF
)
````

The ``$sql`` variable now holds the new-line characters too. You can verify with ``echo -e "$sql"``.

###  Pass multi-line string to a file in Bash
````bash
$ cat <<EOF > print.sh
#!/bin/bash
echo \$PWD
echo $PWD
EOF
````

The ``print.sh`` file now contains:

````bash
#!/bin/bash
echo $PWD
echo /home/user
````

### Pass multi-line string to a pipe in Bash

````bash
$ cat <<EOF | grep 'b' | tee b.txt
foo
bar
baz
EOF
````

The ``b.txt`` file contains bar and baz lines. The same output is printed to stdout.
