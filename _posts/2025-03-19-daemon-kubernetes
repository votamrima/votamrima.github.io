- DaemonSet is a special resource that ensures starting one application instance on each cluster node.
- DaemonSet is widely used to start agents and user workloads. For example, kube-proxy. This service should be run on all cluster and thefore for this purpose is using DaemonSets
- For running a DaemonSet on control-plane nodes it should be configured toleration. This allows the pods to run regardless of the control-plane taints
- DaemonSet in compare with Deployment, doesn't have ``replicas`` and ``strategy``.


Here below is some command.

To apply the DaemonSet I would create a Deployment manifest and by editing it change to DaemonSet

Creating Deployment manifest without starting a deployment:
````bash
seymur@fedora40:/opt/kubernetes/practice$ kubectl create deployment daemon --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml > daemon.yml && ll
total 4
-rw-r--r--. 1 seymur seymur 388 Apr  4 20:52 daemon.yml
seymur@fedora40:/opt/kubernetes/practice$ 
````

In the created file I changed ``kind`` field to ``DeploymentSet``, erased ``replicas: 1`` and ``strategy: {}`` fields. After editing run the file:

````bash
seymur@fedora40:/opt/kubernetes/practice$ kubectl apply -f daemon.yml 
daemonset.apps/daemon created
seymur@fedora40:/opt/kubernetes/practice$ 
````
And check result:

````bash
seymur@fedora40:/opt/kubernetes/practice$ kubectl get all --selector app=daemon -o wide
NAME               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP                NODE                    NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES

seymur@fedora40:/opt/kubernetes/practice$

As you see, there are started 2 pods on each worker node. By default the pods aren't started on control nodes, and to realise such function it should be configured toleration on the control nodes.
