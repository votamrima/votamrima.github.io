Confidentiality is the first principle of the [CIA Triad](./2024. 

Confidentialit measures the protection of the secrecy of:
	- data
	- objects
	- resources

Confidentiality protection:
- GOAL:  is to prevent or minimize unauthorized access data
- prevents disclosure while protecting authorized access


Violations of confidentiality are not limited to attacks. Many disclosure of information are result of:
- human error
- oversight
- ineptitude
- actions of end user
- system administrator
- oversight in a security policy
- misconfigured security control


Contermeasures that can help against possible threats:
- encryption
- network traffic padding
- strict access control
- rigorous authentication procedures
- data classification
- extensive personal training


In the following table are given concepts, conditions and aspects of the confidentiality:

|             |                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Criticality | The higher the level of criticality, the more likely the need to maintation the confidentiality                                                                          |
| Concealment | the act of hiding or preventing disclosure. Another concept to concealment is obscurity - attempts to gain protection through hiding, silence or secrecy the information |
| Secrecy     | The act of keeping information in a secret                                                                                                                               |

| Seclusion   | About storing information in isolated, out-of-the-way location with strict access controls                                                                               |
